- 👋 Hi, I’m @richmon123
- 👀 I’m interested in Loop (I have an iphone, but No Apple Mac, though I can & have access through family members)
-  🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can to keep my Loop system running. I'm fairly active, and Loop has been great for surfing & skiing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, on anything where common ground & my specific skills would be needed.
- 📫 How to reach me email at first is probably best rlanet2@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: None issue for me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a builder & an artist
